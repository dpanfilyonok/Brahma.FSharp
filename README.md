**Brahma.FSharp** provides a way to utilize GPGPU in your F# programs. It is based on F# quotations to OpenCL translation.

## Features
* Utilization of OpenCL for communication with GPU. So, you can work not only with NVIDIA devices but with any device which supports OpenCL (e.g. with AMD ot Intel devices).
* Not only primitive types, but also discriminated unions, structs, records are supported.
* Pattern matching, mutable and immutable bindings, nested bindings are supported.
* Fine-grained memory management and kernels compilation process.
* Mailbox processor based interface for communication with devices.

More details are available [here](https://yaccconstructor.github.io/Brahma.FSharp/).
Examples of usage are available [here](https://github.com/YaccConstructor/Brahma.FSharp.Examples).

## Installation
Install Brahma.FSharp by running:
```shell
dotnet add package Brahma.FSharp
```

Setup BRAHMA_OCL_PATH environment variable to opencl.dll location if it differs from default.

## Quick Start
```f# script
open Brahma.FSharp

let device = ClDevice.GetFirstAppropriateDevice()
let context = RuntimeContext(device)

let kernel =
    <@
        fun (range: Range1D) (buffer: int clarray) ->
            let gid = range.GlobalID0
            buffer.[gid] <- buffer.[gid] + 1
    @>

opencl {
    use! buffer = ClArray.alloc<int> 1024
    do! runCommand kernel <| fun kernel ->
        kernel
        <| Range1D(1024, 256)
        <| buffer

    return! ClArray.toHost buffer
}
|> ClTask.runSync context
```
